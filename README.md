## 🧠 What You'll Learn
This course will provide comprehensive coverage of foundational and advanced topics in AI, focusing on both theoretical reasoning and practical implementation. Topics include:

### 🔍 Search and Planning
- **A\*** Search and Cost-Optimality
- **Heuristics**: Admissibility and consistency
- **Hill Climbing**, Plateaus, and Local Minima
- **Deterministic Planning Problems**
- State-Space Exploration in **Partially Observable** or **Non-deterministic** Environments

### 🧩 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
- **Propositional Logic** and First-Order Logic
- **Horn Clauses** and **Implicative Normal Form**
- **Unification** and **Resolution**
- Designing and reasoning over **Knowledge Bases**
- Translating **Natural Language** into logic predicates

### 📊 Probabilistic Models & Inference
- **Bayesian Networks** (Naive Bayes structure)
- Computing **Posterior Probabilities** given evidence
- Working with **CPTs** and calculating marginal probabilities
- Forward Inference in **Hidden Markov Models** (HMMs)

### 🌳 Decision Trees and Information Theory
- **Shannon Entropy** and **Information Gain**
- Building **Decision Trees** using Gain Criteria
- Attribute selection and entropy-weighted measures

### 🎯 Machine Learning Thinking
- Generalization vs Overfitting
- Cross-validation for **hyperparameter tuning**
